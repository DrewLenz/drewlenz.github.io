        <h2>
            16-bit Single Bus Control Processing Unit
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is one of the projects I worked on for a computer architecture and organization class
            I took in the Spring of 2017. I worked with a partner on this project and learned a lot about how 
            computers actually work. We were given design specifications and an instruction set and had to
            design a control processing unit which could handle these instrcutions. The project took a 
            lot of time, but at the end of this project we had a working simulation of the unit we designed.

        <h2>
            Pipelined Control Processing Unit
        </h2>
        <p>
            This project can be seen as a continuation of our single bus CPU. The challenge of this project
            was to make the same CPU but with a pipelined datapath. This presented some unique challenges
            as we had to consider where each step should occur. Additionally, we had to optimize each step of 
            the path so that each stage took a minimal amount of clock cycles.
