                One of the main assignments for an Artificial Intelligence class that I recently took
                was to develop algorithms that could solve a fifteen square puzzle. A start and end state
                were to be input via command line. My code would output the moves needed to solve the 
                puzzle configuration as well as the cost of solving the puzzle. The cost of moving a tile
                valued less than 10 was 1. The cost of moving a tile with a value of 10 or higher was 10.
            </p>
            <p>
                    In the first version of the assignment, I was instructed to use a breadth-first search 
                    algorithm and then develop heuristic algorithms for two different sets of move cost rules.
                    The breadth-first search simply iterated over all possible moves from the start until the 
                    goal state was reached. The first heuristic function estimated cost by counting how many tiles 
                    on the board were not yet in the right spot. The second heuristic function compared the positions 
                    of each tile to where the tile needed to be moved. The distance of each tile from its destination 
                    determined the estimated cost. For both heuristic searches, the estimated cost was added to the 
                    cost of moving up to that point to determine an H value. Moves with the lowest H value were visited
                    first until the goal state was reached.

            The second assignment built on code from the first assignment. The class was instructed to optimize
            the Heuristic algorithm we developed in our first assignment to minimize the number of nodes 
            needed to find the solution path. For this assignment, our cost was modified so each tile was
            the price of its face value. The inputs for this code are the same as for the first part.
