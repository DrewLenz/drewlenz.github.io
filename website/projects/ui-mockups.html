            CAPP (Co-op Application Pairing Platform)
        </h2>
        <p>
            For my Senior Design project, my partner and I are working on a co-op application platform. It
            is based on PAL, the website University of Cincinnati students currently use to search for co-ops.
            Our goal is to develop an interface that is easier to use and performs faster than UC's 
            current system. We hope this app will be something students can use casually without
            having to set aside a lot of time in their schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also hope to help employers more efficiently find qualified applicants. We will use a 
            profile system which allows employers to filter through applicants that meet their requirements.
            This is a massive improvement over what PAL offers since employers are given a folder
            of .pdf files that they cannot search through. We hope offering these filtering features
            will entice employers to use our platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since our app focuses on streamlining the user experience for all our users, a clean
            user interface is very important. Shown below are some mockups I designed for how I think
            our UI should look.
        </p>
        <h3>Applicant Profile Card</h3>
        <p>
            The base of our user interface centers around a feed of what we call profile cards. 
            The profile card shows what we deem to be critical profile information. A user's name,
            a profile blurb we call a "pitch", and their selected top 3 skills are highlighted on this 
            card. Employers can expand the profile to see all the users' skills and info. 
            Employers can save the profile for later with a button currently represented by a star or email
            the applicant with the mail button. 
            
        </p>

            title="Mockup of Applicant Profile Card" class="align-center"/> <!--consider specifying height/width in CSS-->
        <h3>Job Profile Card</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to the applicant profile card, the job profile card shows critical information
            about a position. This includes the position title, the company name, a brief description of
            the job, and top skills the employer wants in their applicants. These skills will be highlighted
            a different color if the applicant has the skill on their own profile. This will help applicants
            quickly see jobs they might be qualified for. Applicants can save the profile
            for later with the button currently represented by a star. Applicants can apply to the job and 
            send their profile to the company with the button represented by a green checkmark.
        </p>

        <h3>Job Feed (Appplicant View)</h3>
        <p>
            When an applicant is browsing our app, they will be shown a feed of job cards.
            The idea of this is something like a Twitter or Facebook feed, but with jobs users can apply
            to. We think this will be more visually interesting than the text-based lists of jobs provided in 
            PAL and other job search websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of the feed, there are filtering tools which they can use to better define the jobs 
            they are looking for. At this time, there are 4 ways applicants can filter positions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>By Major - Applicants are shown jobs that are looking for students in their field of study</li>
            <li>By Location - Applicants are shown jobs in a location near them</li>
            <li>Best Fit - Applicants are shown jobs which are a match for their top skills</li>
            <li>Custom Search - Applicants can enter their own search criteria</li>
        </ul>

        title="Mockup of Feed as Shown to Applicants" class="align-center"/>
        <h3>Custom Search</h3>
        <p>
            Users will be allowed to enter their own search criteria in the custom search bar. 
            We hope to apply the crieteria as they type new terms. The mockup below shows a search
            for a specific GPA level, a specific skill, and an incomplete term.
        </p>

        title="Mockup of Custom Search" class="align-center"/>
        <p>
            Additionally, I created multiple mockups for how our custom search bar could look based on 
            what makes most sense visually.
        </p>

        search bar designs" title="Mockups of the Custom Search Bar" class="align-center"/>

        <p>
            For now, these designs are only mockups as our project is a work in progress. I hope to 
            update this site later when the project is further along.
