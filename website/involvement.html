            <p>
                For my final year of school, I have been working as a teaching assistant for University of Cincinnati's 
                first-year engineering courses, Engineering Design Thinking 1 and 2. These classes are designed 
                to teach students engineering design concepts and also various programming languages. I have helped
                students learn programming basics like conditional logic flow, iterating loops, and functions. 
                Languages covered in this class include Excel, LabView, Matlab, and Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have enjoyed my experience with this class so far. I've found that I like working with students
                much more than I anticipated. I think helping students with programming is an enjoyable challenge.
                It requires me to think about how to best explain to beginners concepts I now take for granted. 
                I also interact with students in a peer mentoring capacity. In this role, I have helped students 
                become familiar with UC and prepare for their careers.

        <h2>Bearcast Radio DJ</h2>
        <p>
            For a couple semesters, I had a radio show on UC's student radio service, Bearcast Media.
            I love music and had a great time with this project. Each week, I tried to balance an hour of 
            new music and a themed hour of music. Some examples of themes I did were all covers, all artists 
            from Canada, and all songs recorded or produced by one of my favorite artists, Brian Eno. This was
            a really cool experience and a nice break from thinking about my usual course work.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have Spotify, you can check out some of the themed segments from the show below.
