    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Drew Lenz. I am a fifth-year senior at the University of Cincinnati. I am studying for a bachelor's degree in computer engineering 
        with a minor in computer science. I have completed 5 co-op experiences during my time in college. However, I've never done any work with 
        HTML or website development. I hope this website will provide me the opportunity to learn more about this and develop a place to showcase some
        other work I've done over the years.
